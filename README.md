🎋 Intro:

This project is a React application that implements features like dark mode and image search using the Unsplash API. It provides users with the ability to toggle between light and dark themes and search for images based on their input.

📦 Tech Stack:

* React
* React Hooks
* React Context API
* React Query
* CSS (for styling)
* Unsplash API

👩🏽‍🍳 Features:

1. Dark Mode Toggle:
* Users can switch between light and dark themes by toggling a button.
* Dark mode preference is stored in local storage for persistence.

2. Image Search:
* Users can input search queries to fetch and display images from the Unsplash API.
* Images are loaded dynamically based on the search input.

3. Dynamic Gallery Display:

* The application displays a gallery of images fetched from Unsplash based on the search query.
* Images are displayed in a responsive grid layout.

💭 Process:

* Started by setting up the project structure and installing necessary dependencies.
* Implemented the global context provider (AppContext) to manage dark mode and search functionalities.
* Created components for theme toggle, search form, and image gallery.
* Utilized React Query for data fetching and management.
* Tested the application for functionality and responsiveness.
* Faced challenges in handling API requests and managing state across components but overcame them through research and experimentation.

📚 Learnings:

* Enhanced understanding of React's Context API and custom hooks for global state management.
* Gained experience in integrating third-party APIs (Unsplash API) into a React application.
* Improved skills in responsive web design and component-based architecture.

✨ Improvement:

* Implement pagination for the image gallery to handle large sets of search results more efficiently.
* Enhance error handling and user feedback for better usability.
* Optimize performance by lazy loading images and optimizing API requests.
